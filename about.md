# About Stacked Systems

Welcome to Stacked Systems, a blog focused on homelab infrastructure, systems engineering, and AI-augmented workflows. 

## Who Am I?

I'm a systems engineer with a passion for building and optimizing infrastructure. By day, I work in enterprise IT; by night, I experiment with cutting-edge technologies in my homelab. My background spans virtualization, storage systems, networking, and automation, with a growing focus on integrating AI tools into traditional systems management.

## My Homelab

My current homelab setup includes:

- **Compute**: Proxmox VE cluster with 3 nodes
- **Storage**: TrueNAS Scale with ZFS
- **Networking**: OPNsense with VLANs and 10GbE
- **Containers**: Kubernetes for application workloads
- **Automation**: Ansible, Terraform, and custom MCP integrations
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and custom dashboards

## About This Blog

This blog serves several purposes:

1. **Documentation**: A living record of my technical experiments and configurations
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Helping others avoid the pitfalls I've encountered
3. **Community Building**: Connecting with other homelab enthusiasts and systems engineers
4. **AI Exploration**: Documenting my journey integrating AI tools like Claude into systems engineering workflows

## Blog Technology

This blog itself is an experiment in AI-augmented content management:

- Built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
- Managed through Model Context Protocol (MCP) using Claude AI
- Content generation assisted by AI while maintaining technical accuracy and personal experience
- Open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eddygk/stacked-systems)

## Acknowledgments

This blog wouldn't be possible without the amazing open source communities behind Proxmox, TrueNAS, Kubernetes, and the countless other tools that make modern infrastructure possible. Special thanks to Anthropic for Claude AI and the Model Context Protocol that helps manage this site.
