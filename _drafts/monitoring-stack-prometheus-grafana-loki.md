# Building a Complete Homelab Monitoring Stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki

*Note: This is a draft post and is still being developed.*

Monitoring is a critical aspect of any infrastructure setup, especially when running multiple services and systems in a homelab environment. In this post, I'll share my complete monitoring stack based on Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, and how I've integrated it with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-augmented monitoring.

## The Monitoring Challenge

When running a homelab with multiple servers, virtual machines, containers, and applications, effective monitoring becomes essential for:

1. **Availability tracking** - Knowing when services go down
2. **Performance analysis** - Identifying bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. **Capacity planning** - Understanding resource usage trends
4. **Troubleshooting** - Finding the root cause of issues quickly
5. **Predictive maintenance** - Addressing problems before they impact services

My monitoring requirements include:

- **Metrics collection**: CPU, memory, disk, network for all systems
- **Log aggregation**: Centralized logs from all services
- **Alerting**: Notifications for critical issues
- **Visualization**: Dashboards for quick assessment
- **Historical data**: Long-term storage for trend analysis
- **AI integration**: Using Claude and MCP for automated analysis

## The Solution: Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki

After trying several solutions, I've settled on the following stack:

### 1. Prometheus for Metrics

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It's perfect for monitoring containerized environments.

### 2. Grafana for Visualization

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) provides beautiful, flexible dashboards to visualize metrics from Prometheus and logs from Loki.

### 3. Loki for Logs

[Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) is a log aggregation system designed to be cost-effective and easy to operate.
