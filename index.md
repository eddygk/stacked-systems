# Stacked Systems: An Engineer's AI Journey

Welcome to my digital workshop where I document my personal tech experiments, infrastructure projects, systems engineering builds, and AI-augmented workflows. This blog serves as a living record of my evolving home lab environment, technical curiosities, and applied automation.

## Featured Topics

- **Homelab Infrastructure**: Proxmox VE, TrueNAS Scale, ZFS, and network configuration
- **Systems Engineering**: Automation, containerization, and infrastructure as code
- **AI-Augmented Workflows**: Integrating Claude, MCP, and other AI tools into daily tech operations
- **Experiments & Projects**: Documenting trials, errors, and successes in my technical journey
